            my story
          </h3>
          <h5 class="white-text">A few years ago I invited my best friend, Joel, to come sit in for a studio session while I was producing an album for my band called Arkivist. Joel was my best friend and roommate during college when I was writing the opera.  I figured he must be thinking, “this is so incredibly boring.” When people think of being in a band, they think of lively concerts, jamming, and inspirational moments of creative genius; but what they don’t realize is there is A TON of time spent in the “lab”. You’re toiling away on a computer for hours and days to perfect the smallest of details. This is where you connect the dots and draw lines. You work like this only to realize your song is too long or repetitive and the section you’re working on should probably be eliminated, making all the hard work you did on the details completely irrelevant.
            <br />
            <br />
            But to my surprise, Joel turned to me and said, “This is really cool! Have you ever heard of a book called CODE?” Joel, it turns out, wasn’t bored at all because he saw tons of overlap with his new passion - coding.  After college Joel became a middle school teacher but eventually decided to make a change and started searching. He read books, played around online, and before long got an internship at a tiny programming shop where he learned a lot and then got hired on full time.  It was around that time when Joel told me about CODE  and the transferable skills he could see between what I was already very good at, and what he had been learning.
            <br />
            <br />
            It took me years to actually read the book. I moved to LA to continue my music career but after years of small victories chasing those dreams I decided it was time for a change.  Joel had become a full stack developer and moved cities. Encouraged by his experience and reminded of our conversation, I decided to crack that book open.  I realized what Joel was saying in the studio was that he could relate with my weird obsession with detail and perfecting every note, rhythm, and every pitch.  He is a good programmer and he knows me. He wanted me to see that I could be too if I personally took the steps to discover it. Within weeks of reading the book, I was determined to learn how to program.  I took a risk and applied for a web development bootcamp at General Assembly, was accepted and completed it in April.
            <br />
            <br />
            During my time as a developer, I’ve had days where I felt like the king of the world and days where I thought I would never every be a good programmer.  The thing that stays consistent, though, is that I know that if I just keep going, I will absolutely get better and grow as a coder.  I’m so excited to enter the field as a full stack web developer and continue the same passion I have for music in my career as a programmer.
